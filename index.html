    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a passionate 13-year-old Python and web developer who loves creating interactive games, fun projects, and practical web applications. 
      This website showcases some of my best work, including Python projects like Tic-Tac-Toe and the 21 Number Game, as well as web projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy problem-solving, learning new coding skills, and building projects that are both fun and useful. My goal is to grow as a developer and help clients bring their ideas to life through clean, well-designed, and functional code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to get in touch via email or GitHub. I’m excited to collaborate and create amazing things together!
